Conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis between the Dot-com bubble era (1998-2002) and the current AI bubble (2022-present) using Python and financial data APIs. Analyzed stock performance, volatility, maximum drawdowns, and market capitalization metrics for representative companies from both eras. The analysis revealed that while the AI era shows higher average returns (279% vs 186%), it also demonstrates lower volatility (51% vs 67%) and less severe drawdowns compared to the Dot-com bubble. This project utilized statistical methods including normalized price trajectories, rolling volatility calculations, and comparative risk-return analysis to identify key differences between the two market periods.
